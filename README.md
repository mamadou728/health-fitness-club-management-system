## Project Overview

This project is a **Health & Fitness Club Management System** designed to model and manage the core operations of a modern gym or fitness center.

The system is built around a **PostgreSQL relational database** and is focused on clean data modeling, reliable constraints, and realistic business rules. It supports multiple user roles:

- **Members** – manage their profile, fitness goals, health metrics, and class or personal training bookings.
- **Trainers** – define their availability, view upcoming sessions, and access relevant member information.
- **Admins** – manage rooms, group classes, equipment, and basic billing information.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:

- Solid **relational schema design** (ER modeling, normalization, keys, constraints).
- Practical **database-backed application logic** (for example: preventing double bookings, enforcing capacity limits, validating trainer availability).
- Clear, maintainable **code structure** that separates data access, business rules, and user interaction.

This repository is a work in progress and will evolve as we refine the database schema, implement more features, and improve the overall design.
